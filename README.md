# Steamworks
Gosu-based ruby game

Sets up some base classes to easily add objects to a game window.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `ruby steamworks.rb`

## Features

Pilot a super awesome ship (or the letter X, if your imagination is lacking) around a screen. And fire a bullet! But hopefully you just want the 
bullet to go in one direction, because it only goes in one direction.
